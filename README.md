# grid
grid is an online chess game inspired by Lichess. i created it for the Hack Club Siege YSWS, (week 6) whose theme was 'grid' (shocking!)

i tried to make grid as feature-packed as i could. it has:
- a pawn promotion system
- animated piece movement
- lichess-esque graphics
- board flipping
- reverse/forward time stuff
- resignation
- draws
- (attempted to create) en passant 

i really hope you like this project, just like how i enjoyed creating it.
thanks!
